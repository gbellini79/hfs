The successor of AEX's MNG2AVI is an humble frame server built to convert MNG and WAV files generated by MAME commands -mngwrite and -wavwrite.

It has been used for basically all videos published by [AEX](https://www.youtube.com/arcadeextreme) and [MAME Retro Avengers](https://www.youtube.com/mameretroavengers).

It's meant to be used in conjunction with FFMPEG (or other similar utilities) via pipe and it features a simple scripting language with some basic funtionality:
- import MNG video files
- import WAV audio files
- import PNG, JPG, BMP and GIF image files
- resize, crop, trim and join videos
- fadein, fadeout and cross dissolve
- solid color images and silence generation
- overlay of multiple videos
- superimpose of text and (crude) timers

## Disclaimer

This software is a specialized tool designed exclusively to overcome the lack of an easy way to convert MAME-generatd MNG files into more widely used video formats.

It therefore does not support the full range of MNG features but focuses on the specific subset of the MNG specification required to handle MNG files created with the MAME -mngwrite command.

Please note that this software was written (in 2018!) primarly for personal use and has limitations, it has not undergone extensive testing or optimization, and documentation is minimal.

I have decided to open-source the code primarily to assist a friend (RAX) who needed some of its functionality. Additionally, I was surprised to learn that the original AEX's MNG2AVI tool has found a wider audience than I expected outside of AEX!

Finally, while I plan to release a (mostly) stable version in the near future, I do not expect to actively develop it further, add new features or fix any bugs.
